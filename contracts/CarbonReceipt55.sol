    /**
     * @dev Hook that is called before any token transfer. This includes minting
     * and burning, as well as batched variants.
     *
     * The same hook is called on both single and batched variants. For single
     * transfers, the length of the `id` and `amount` arrays will be 1.
     *
     * Calling conditions (for each `id` and `amount` pair):
     *
     * - When `from` and `to` are both non-zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens
     * of token type `id` will be  transferred to `to`.
     * - When `from` is zero, `amount` tokens of token type `id` will be minted
     * for `to`.
     * - when `to` is zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens of token type `id`
     * will be burned.
     * - `from` and `to` are never both zero.
     * - `ids` and `amounts` have the same, non-zero length.
     *
     * To learn more about hooks, head to xref:ROOT:extending-contracts.adoc#using-hooks[Using Hooks].
